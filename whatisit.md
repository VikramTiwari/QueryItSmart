# What is it

With this demo, we featured [BigQuery](http://cloud.google.com/bigquery), a fast, economical and fully-managed data warehouse for large-scale data analytics, combined with Cloud Machine Learning Engine ([ML Engine](http://cloud.google.com/ml)), a managed and scalable machine learning platform.

## BigQuery democratizes data

With the petabit network and large-scale container technology deployed in our datacenters, BigQuery can collect fractions of computing power, memory and storage quickly from thousands of machines, fabricating them as a Massively Parallel Processing (MPP) engine for every single SQL query running on the service.

With this unique architecture, BigQuery frees you from the typical headaches of data processing and provides high performance, lower cost, better management and  ease-of-access. Queries on terabytes of data finishes in tens of seconds with the economy of cloud, so you can run various ad-hoc queries quickly and iteratively.

BigQuery allows everyone in an enterprise to easily access the real-time production data with their own SQL or BI tools, because any slow query or error doesn't affect the performance and availability of the whole service. Non-engineers and business users can own the data.

## Cloud Machine Learning adds “smart” search on BigQuery

With the QueryIt Smart demo, we added one more flavor to BigQuery, which is the smartness of Machine Learning.

The traditional SQL data warehouse has been optimized for structured data with programmable logic, but it’s not as strong at handling unstructured data with the "senses" or "instincts" of humans.

This is where machine learning can help. By designing a deep neural network for image recognition with TensorFlow and training it with Cloud Machine Learning Engine, you can have a model (consists of a bunch of parameters) that captures how humans use their senses and instincts to recognize images correctly. Once the training is finished, you can use 
the model in various runtime environments. For example, you could use Machine Engine's prediction service to build a large scale online service or to run batch processing, or you can run TensorFlow prediction inside smartphones and Raspberry Pi for high-quality image recognition in edge devices.

In the QueryIt Smart installation, we used the [User Defined Function (UDF)](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/user-defined-functions) of BigQuery to run the image recognition with a deep neural network model trained by ML Engine. Because the JavaScript code written with UDF runs with the same MPP architecture of BigQuery, we could take advantage of the massive computing power for a large-scale machine learning prediction.

By using UDF, we have implemented the following applications:

- **Document similarity search**: extracting feature vectors (TF-IDF) of 10M documents from Stack Overflow posts and use UDF to compare similarity between documents in tens of seconds
- **Image similarity search**: extracting feature vectors of 1M images from Wikimedia Commons by appling CNN (VGG16) with ML Engine, import them to Google Cloud Storage, and use them with UDF to compare similarity between images in tens of seconds
- **Large scale demand forecast**: training Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) for NYC Citi Bike demand forecast with ML Engine, import them to Google Cloud Storage, and apply them to hundreds of different location in Manhattan in parallel by implementing MLP prediction with UDF.
